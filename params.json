This system works in concert with\r\nthe \"one buffer per session\" approach to minimize write overhead.\r\n\r\nBecause of this approach, no Netty encoder is needed. Packet queueing is completely avoided for both incoming and\r\noutgoing packets in favor of spare flushing.\r\n\r\n#### Single thread for the whole server\r\nUsing a single game thread allows you to use simplistic, overhead-free techniques and libraries.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Credits\r\n\r\n[**Dane**](https://github.com/thedaneeffect/), **Flamable**, **Sino**, [**thing1**](https://github.com/RyanDennis03),\r\n[**Wizard Jesse**](https://github.com/WizardJesse1), and **Colby** - for chat, banter, and remarks about the way of design,\r\nand consultancy during the development process.\r\n\r\n[**Graham Edgecombe**](https://github.com/grahamedgecombe/) - for his previous work on frameworks like Hyperion, Apollo,\r\n and ScapeEmulator which significantly impacted and redefined the ways RuneScape emulators are written.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Media\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/H1u9os0.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Sponsored\r\n\r\n[![YourKit](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/index.jsp)\r\n\r\nWe use YourKit Java Profiler to ensure we're getting the performance we expect.\r\n\r\n[![Netty](http://i.imgur.com/73YTNlm.png)](http://netty.io/)\r\n\r\nNetty provides us with the high-performance networking and concurrent libraries used to achieve our performance.\r\nWe worked with the Netty team to optimize and improve our throughput.",
